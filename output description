1. The Transaction Graph (The "Spider Web")
Think of this as a map of your financial ecosystem.

The Nodes (Circles): Each circle represents a unique bank account.
The Edges (Lines): Each line represents money moving from one account to another.
The Colors: We color the accounts from Green (Safe) to Red (Critical Risk).
What it tells you: If you see a tight cluster of red nodes all sending money to each other in a circle, that is a classic "fraud ring" pattern.
2. Fraud Clusters (The "Neighborhoods")
The system uses an algorithm to group accounts into "communities" or neighborhoods based on who they interact with most.

Why it matters: Criminals often create many fake accounts that only talk to each other. By grouping them, we can see if a specific "neighborhood" has a high percentage of suspicious activity, even if the individual transactions look small and harmless.
3. The "Brain" (How it calculates Risk)
We don't just guess; we use four different "detectives" to look at every account:

Isolation Forest: This looks for "loners"—transactions that look physically different from everything else (e.g., a massive $50,000 transfer at 3 AM from an account that usually only spends $20).
Local Outlier Factor (LOF): This looks for accounts that are acting weird compared to their immediate neighbors.
Graph Centrality: This measures how "important" an account is in the network. An account that sits in the middle of hundreds of transfers might be a "money mule" or a clearinghouse for stolen funds.
GNN (Graph Neural Network): This is the most advanced part. It’s an AI that learns the shape of fraud. It looks at the patterns of your neighbors to decide if you are likely to be part of a scam.
4. Top Risky Accounts (The "Most Wanted" List)
In this tab, we give you a ranked list of the most suspicious accounts.

The Explanation: If you click on an account, the AI will actually tell you why it's worried. For example: "This account is a bridge between two unrelated groups" or "It has an unusually high frequency of night-time transactions."
5. Live Scoring (The "Gatekeeper")
This is where you can test "What if?" scenarios. If you're about to approve a new transaction, you can type it in here. The system will instantly plug it into the big web, rerun all the math, and tell you if that new payment makes the involved accounts look more dangerous.

To see it in action: Go to the "Upload & Process" tab and click "Use Sample Dataset". Once it finishes, the other tabs will fill up with data you can explore!
